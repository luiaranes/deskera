                <p>
                    The first breath of fresh air away from college. A million thoughts run through <br>
                    you as you pick the place of employment you choose to apply for. At this stage <br>
                    of your life, you are identifying what it takes to be the successful career woman. <br>
                    <br> 
                    At the start, you maneuver through work, learning as you go along. With more <br>
                    experience, you advance your career and start saving up to fulfil that eye- <br>
                    opening backpacking trip you desire. For a brief moment of your millennial life, <br>
                    you feel satisfied with your globetrotter status. <br>
                    <br>
                    Over time, travel fatigue sets in and you reach a certain age of your life where <br>
                    you think you are ready to settle down and start a family. <br>
                    <br>
                    To cope with the high costs of living, you aspire to advance your career to give  <br>
                    your family the best of the best. Growing into a mother, you put others before  <br>
                    you and nurture the needs of your family.  <br>
                    <br>
                    As the years grow by, your career brings you to a circle of high achievers who  <br>
                    support you in your growth to develop your own business. Being of a certain  <br>
                    level of maturity in your career, and seeking the flexibility of time in caring for  <br>
                    your family, you take the leap and quit your job, no looking back.  <br>
                    <br>
                    You seek advice from other women entrepreneurs who empower you to achieve <br>
                    work-life balance, made easier with technological advancements. Monitor your  <br>
                    staff’s progress with a good human resource management system (HRMS) and  <br>
                    empower others by implementing a self-service leave application software.  <br>
                    Implementing a customer relationship management software helps you build  <br>
                    better client relationships as it centralizes data and track past engagement with  <br>
                    clients.  <br>
